"""Content guard for Richard's public career repos.

Every pattern here corresponds to something that actually went wrong in these
repositories, not a generic template. Structure checks are a floor; the real
risk in a public repo written by multiple agents is what the words say.

Exit 1 on any hit. Scans only files git tracks.
